1- How do I approach designing software?

I usually start my software design process by doing the most in-depth analysis I can on the project demands to get a clear picture of exactly what I'm working on. After that's finished, I start assigning tasks to each project element into bucket categories so that work can be distributed later. After that's finished, I get to work on developing the current items. During the two plus years I've worked in the CS industry, this approach has proven to be very effective for me.

2- How do I approach developing programs?

In order to demonstrate to my client that the idea is workable and to solicit feedback on how to make the application as user-tailored as feasible, I actually establish an operational minimum-viable product before moving on to the real software development process. It's just more of these developer feedback periods for the remainder of the creation time.

3- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science gives me a fulfilling career that allows me to support my loved ones and helps me achieve my goals. I hadn't been looking forward to getting up every day to go to the office when I began working in the field of computers.
